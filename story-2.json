You see, Emmy felt ashamed of anything having to do with her reproductive health, as her parents never spoke about it with her.\n[[Yeah it's very well written.|you_lier]]\n[[Not yet.|go_read_it]]\n[[Yes and it sucks.

When really, she only discovered there was something wrong by way of a third doctor's appointment.\n[[{{bobby}} The diagnosis felt scary.
